    `Welcome to the Dungeon crawler game!
     This game was created using HTML/CSS,
     SCSS, JS(ES6) and React`,

     `In order to win you have to kill all
     of the enemies and every level's boss`,

     `You can control your character using
     W-A-S-D buttons or, if you are playing
     the game via your phone or tablet, using
     arrows which appear on the right-bottom corner
     of your screen`,

     `There is a scoreboard located on top of
     your screen (or on the left, in case you are
     using phone) with amount of enemies and
     equipment left on the current level. There
     also are buttons for game fog toggling and
     game reloading`,

     `Originally, almost all of the game board
     is hidden under the fog, but you can turn on/off
     the fog using the button mentioned before`,

     `In the top-left corner of the gamefield you can
     see your character stats: HP, EXP and level`,

     `On the left on the screen your character backpack
     and his items are placed. Backpack has a limited
     capacity. You can put on/take off items or delete them.
     Every item has two attributes: damage and armor`,

     `You can put on/take off/delete an item using double
     click. Or, if you are using PC, you can just drag an item
     between backpack and the character`,

     `Items in your backpack which have at least one of the
     attributes better than the corresponing item on your character
     will be highlighted`,

     `You can move between the game levels using doors.
     You can easily get to the previous level, but if you
     want to go on the next level you have to kill all of
     the enemies on the current level`,

     `I worked hard trying to remove all of the possible
     bugs, but, unfortunately, I might have left one of them.
     If some sort of bug occurs, please just reload the game
     using the reload button or reload the whole page`,

     `Good luck!`
